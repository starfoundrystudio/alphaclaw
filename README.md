> **Platform:** AlphaClaw currently targets Docker/Linux deployments. macOS local development is not yet supported.

## Features

- **Setup UI:** Password-protected web dashboard for onboarding, configuration, and day-to-day management.
- **Guided Onboarding:** Step-by-step setup wizard — model selection, provider credentials, GitHub repo, channel pairing.
- **Multi-Agent Management:** Sidebar-driven agent navigation with create, rename, and delete flows. Per-agent overview cards, channel bindings, and URL-driven agent selection.
- **Gateway Manager:** Spawns, monitors, restarts, and proxies the OpenClaw gateway as a managed child process.
- **Watchdog:** Crash detection, crash-loop recovery, auto-repair (`openclaw doctor --fix`), Telegram/Discord/Slack notifications, and a live interactive terminal for monitoring gateway output directly from the browser.
- **Channel Orchestration:** Telegram, Discord, and Slack bot pairing with per-agent channel bindings, credential sync, and a guided wizard for splitting Telegram into multi-threaded topic groups as your usage grows.
- **Google Workspace:** OAuth integration for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Tasks, Contacts, and Meet, plus guided Gmail watch setup with Google Pub/Sub topic, subscription, and push endpoint handling.
- **Cron Jobs:** Dedicated cron tab with job management, an interactive rolling calendar, run-history drilldowns, trend analytics, and per-run usage breakdowns.
- **Nodes:** Guided local-node setup for VPS deployments with per-node browser attach checks, reconnect commands, and routing/pairing controls.
- **Webhooks:** Named webhook endpoints with per-hook transform modules, request logging, payload inspection, editable delivery destinations, and OAuth callback support for third-party auth flows.
- **File Explorer:** Browser-based workspace explorer with file visibility, inline edits, diff view, and Git-aware sync for quick fixes without SSH.
- **Prompt Hardening:** Ships anti-drift bootstrap prompts (`AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`) injected into your agent's system prompt on every message — enforcing safe practices, commit discipline, and change summaries out of the box.
- **Git Sync:** Automatic hourly commits of your OpenClaw workspace to GitHub with configurable cron schedule. Combined with prompt hardening, every agent action is version-controlled and auditable.
- **Version Management:** In-place updates for both AlphaClaw and OpenClaw with in-app release notes, changelog review, and one-click apply.
- **Codex OAuth:** Built-in PKCE flow for OpenAI Codex CLI model access.

## Why AlphaClaw

- **Zero to production in one deploy:** Railway/Render templates ship a complete stack — no manual gateway setup.
- **Self-healing:** Watchdog detects crashes, enters repair mode, relaunches the gateway, and notifies you.
- **Everything in the browser:** No SSH, no config files to hand-edit, no CLI required after first deploy.
- **Stays out of the way:** AlphaClaw manages infrastructure; OpenClaw handles the AI.

## No Lock-in. Eject Anytime.

AlphaClaw simply wraps OpenClaw, it's not a dependency. Remove AlphaClaw and your agent keeps running. Nothing proprietary, nothing to migrate.

## Quick Start

### Deploy (recommended)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/openclaw-fast-start?referralCode=jcFhp_&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)
[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/chrysb/openclaw-render-template)

Set `SETUP_PASSWORD` at deploy time and visit your deployment URL. The welcome wizard handles the rest.

> **Railway users:** after deploying, upgrade to the **Hobby plan** and redeploy to ensure your service has at least **8 GB of RAM**. The Trial plan's memory limit can cause out-of-memory crashes during normal operation.

### Local / Docker

```bash
npm install @chrysb/alphaclaw
npx alphaclaw start
```

Or with Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl procps cron tini && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install --omit=dev
ENV PATH="/app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
ENV ALPHACLAW_ROOT_DIR=/data
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/tini", "--"]
CMD ["alphaclaw", "start"]
```

## Watchdog

The built-in watchdog monitors gateway health and recovers from failures automatically.

| Capability               | Details                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Health checks**        | Periodic `openclaw health` with configurable interval                  |
| **Crash detection**      | Listens for gateway exit events                                        |
| **Crash-loop detection** | Threshold-based (default: 3 crashes in 300s)                           |
| **Auto-repair**          | Runs `openclaw doctor --fix --yes`, relaunches gateway                 |
| **Notifications**        | Telegram, Discord, and Slack alerts for crashes, repairs, and recovery |
| **Event log**            | SQLite-backed incident history with API and UI access                  |

## Environment Variables

| Variable                          | Required | Description                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `SETUP_PASSWORD`                  | Yes      | Password for the Setup UI                          |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`          | Auto     | Gateway auth token (auto-generated if unset)       |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`                    | Yes      | GitHub PAT for workspace repo                      |
| `GITHUB_WORKSPACE_REPO`           | Yes      | GitHub repo for workspace sync (e.g. `owner/repo`) |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`              | Optional | Telegram bot token                                 |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`               | Optional | Discord bot token                                  |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`                 | Optional | Slack bot token (Socket Mode)                      |
| `WATCHDOG_AUTO_REPAIR`            | Optional | Enable auto-repair on crash (`true`/`false`)       |
| `WATCHDOG_NOTIFICATIONS_DISABLED` | Optional | Disable watchdog notifications (`true`/`false`)    |
| `PORT`                            | Optional | Server port (default `3000`)                       |
| `ALPHACLAW_ROOT_DIR`              | Optional | Data directory (default `/data`)                   |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS`                | Optional | Trust proxy hop count for correct client IP        |
| `REMOTE_MCP_URL`                  | Optional | Upstream remote MCP server URL. When set together with `REMOTE_MCP_API_TOKEN`, AlphaClaw writes a managed `mcp.servers.<name>` entry to `openclaw.json` on every gateway start. |
| `REMOTE_MCP_API_TOKEN`            | Optional | Bearer token for the remote MCP server. Persisted in `openclaw.json` as the `${REMOTE_MCP_API_TOKEN}` reference, never as plaintext. |
| `REMOTE_MCP_NAME`                 | Optional | Key under `mcp.servers.<name>`. Defaults to `remote`. Set it to label the entry (e.g. `sure`, `notion`). |
| `REMOTE_MCP_PROXY_URL`            | Optional | When set, OpenClaw connects here instead of `REMOTE_MCP_URL`. Intended for a same-host scanning proxy (e.g. `pipelock mcp proxy --listen <REMOTE_MCP_PROXY_URL> --upstream <REMOTE_MCP_URL>`). Implementation is proxy-agnostic. |

## OpenAI-compatible `/v1` proxy

AlphaClaw can expose an OpenAI-compatible API surface on the same public port as the Setup UI. It is disabled by default. Enable it from the Setup UI under General -> Features -> API; the setting is persisted in `alphaclaw.json` in the OpenClaw repo so workspace sync can commit the change.

| Path                            | Method  | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/v1/chat/completions`          | POST    | Streams when `stream: true`. Use `model: "openclaw/default"` or `openclaw/<agentId>`. |
| `/v1/responses`                 | POST    | OpenClaw's `/v1/responses` surface (enabled together with chat completions). |
| `/v1/embeddings`                | POST    | Routes to OpenClaw's embeddings endpoint.                          |
| `/v1/models`, `/v1/models/<id>` | GET     | Lists OpenClaw agent targets.                                      |

When enabled, the proxy forwards requests to the loopback OpenClaw gateway. AlphaClaw requires `Authorization: Bearer <OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN>` and rejects requests when the gateway token is missing or does not match before forwarding to OpenClaw. Failed bearer-token attempts are rate-limited before proxying. The setup-UI cookie is stripped before forwarding, hop-by-hop response headers are not passed through, and `/v1` JSON request bodies are accepted up to 50 MB. When disabled or missing from `alphaclaw.json`, `/v1` requests return 404.

**Security boundary (important).** OpenClaw treats `/v1/chat/completions` as a full operator-access surface. A caller with a valid `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` can run any tool the configured agent profile allows. Treat this token like an owner credential:

- Use this surface only for trusted server-to-server callers (for example, a self-hosted app that needs OpenClaw as its external assistant).
- Do not hand the gateway token to end-user clients.
- If your front door is public (Render, Fly, fly-style PaaS), make sure `SETUP_PASSWORD` is strong and that the gateway token is held by exactly one trusted backend.

When `REMOTE_MCP_URL` + `REMOTE_MCP_API_TOKEN` are set, AlphaClaw also registers an `mcp.servers.<REMOTE_MCP_NAME>` block (default key `remote`) in `openclaw.json` so the agent can call back into that remote MCP server. Set `REMOTE_MCP_PROXY_URL` to route those callbacks through a same-host scanning proxy (for example a Pipelock MCP reverse proxy running in the same container).

## Security Notes

AlphaClaw is a convenience wrapper — it intentionally trades some of OpenClaw's default hardening for ease of setup. You should understand what's different:

| Area                    | What AlphaClaw does                                                                                                                   | Trade-off                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Setup password**      | All gateway access is gated behind a single `SETUP_PASSWORD`. Brute-force protection is built in (exponential backoff lockout).       | Simpler than OpenClaw's pairing code flow, but the password must be strong.                            |
| **One-click pairing**   | Channel pairings (Telegram/Discord/Slack) can be approved from the Setup UI instead of the CLI.                                       | No terminal access required, but anyone with the setup password can approve pairings.                  |
| **Auto CLI approval**   | The first CLI device pairing is auto-approved so you can connect without a second screen. Subsequent requests appear in the UI.       | Removes the manual pairing step for the initial CLI connection.                                        |
| **Query-string tokens** | Webhook URLs support `?token=<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>` for providers that don't support `Authorization` headers. Warnings are shown in the UI. | Tokens may appear in server logs and referrer headers. Use header auth when your provider supports it. |
| **Gateway token**       | `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is auto-generated and injected into the environment so the proxy can authenticate with the gateway.          | The token lives in the `.env` file on the server — standard for managed deployments but worth noting.  |

If you need OpenClaw's full security posture (manual pairing codes, no query-string tokens, no auto-approval), use OpenClaw directly without AlphaClaw.
